# Pre-work - *ZenTip*

**ZenTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Malcolm Parrish**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.  (Went with a differnt UI for this, user selects on the home screen)

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Other areas to add for my next submission, gearing for early next week
-UIAnimations, Locale specific currency

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- properly positioning the UI elements and working with auto layout
- keeping code organized, because I chose to do the UI in code, there is a lot more UI code - challenged to keep it organized and readable
- adding animation, I previously have written an animated label, I had difficult getting the label to animate in this app and plan to return to that in the update
